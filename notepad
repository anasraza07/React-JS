Dont learn React if:
    - you dont know how JS works or DOM works

React learning Process
    1. go in-depth (Babel, fibre, Virtual DOM, diff algo, hydration)
    2. by making projects (one topic at a time)
    projects like Todo, Calculator, Github API

React is a Library
    - frameworks (military) VS library (cool dude)

Topic to learn:
    - core of React (state or UI manipulation, JSX)
    - component Reusability
    - Reusing of component (Props)
    - How to propagate change (hooks)

Additional Addon to React   
    - Router (React dont have router)
    - state management (React had not state management)
        - Redux, Redux toolkit, zustand, context API
    - class based component
        - legacy code
    BAAS (Backend as a service) Apps
        -social media clone, e-commerce apps


LESSON 02:
websites / webapp = react -> react-dom
websites / webapp = react -> react-native
npm = node package manager
npx = node package executer

create-react-app is a utility or software, but ye bht bulky hai extra cheezen bhi deta hai isliye time bht lagta so that we use
npx create vite@latest


LESSON 03:
react khud ka bhi eik dom banaata hai jisay ham kehte hain virtual dom aur phr difference check krta hai real dom aur virtul dom main then sirf unhi elements ko change krdeta hai
Component ka naam capitalised hona chahiye wrna error ayega aur file ka naam bhi capitalised rkhna achi practice hai 
vite main .jsx hi hona chahiye agr jsx return horaha hai 
vite main ye khud script run krdeti hai direct html file main but react main react-scripts run krte hain saari script
SPA = single page application means ke eik hi html ki file hai wahi se content jayega aayega bs eik hi page hai content change hota rahega
